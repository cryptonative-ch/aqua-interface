### Introduction

Mesa is an open initial decentralized offerings (IDOs) platform where IDO Projects can raise capital without any code. 

#### What is our Vision?

Decentralized finance will fundamentally disrupt the traditional way of allocating risk and money throughout the economy. Early stage investments are currently dominated by wealthy angel investors and institutional venture capital firms. While these are well established methods for capital raising, they are however prone to abuse and are heavily biased to those who have the social network to access that world. 

Our vision is to change the way token offerings are  conducted on-chain by offering a platform for organizations that seek early stage capital funding.

IDO projects do not only just require large amounts of capital. They also need an integrated community of investors, users and developers that are able to leverage their talents together to reach new heights.

Our platform will be built as an open and decentralized ecosystem that provides all the tools needed, so that organizations are able to raise funds without the complex technical skills required.
